        <b>Selectors Consulting / Founder</b>
        <i>November 2019 - November 2020, Utrecht and surroundings, Netherlands</i>
        <div></div>
        Under the name Selectors Consulting (Selectors), I focus on recruitment and selection in the Randstad region. I started this because I believe that modern recruitment should carry correct, ethical interests high in its banner and I see that too little in the market. Selectors mainly focuses on emerging IT companies and exclusively with companies that have the best interests of their staff at heart and can also demonstrate this. Worked with clients within robotics (RPA), web development and Mendix consultants. See also www.selectorsconsulting.nl.
